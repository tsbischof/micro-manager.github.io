This adapter provides the ability to get and set wavelengths for a Photon etc LLTF.
The version of the SDK used to build this adapter is 1.2.4.
It has been developed and tested for Windows 10, 64-bit.

### Configuration

To use this adapter, you will need to copy the DLL files from the SDK installer to your ÂµManager installation.
Typically this will be:
* ftd2xx.dll
* PE_Filter_SDK.dll
* QtCore4.dll
* QtXml4.dll

The device should come with an XML file which describes its properties. 
Typically this XML file is installed by the Photon etc installer itself, and you will not need to copy and files yourself.
This adapter will search in the following locations for XML files:
* `.`
* `C:\Program Files\Photon etc\PHySpecV2\Devices`
* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Photon etc\PHySpecV2\Devices`
Any XML file starting with "M0001" will be presented as possible configuration file.
